# RizRazRecipes

🤔

Sometimes people rely on recipes because they are scared of cooking. I personally just use what I have and mix and match, and it's nearly always good. I think that cooking is easy and recipes are somewhat contra-productive to realizing that.

## enter the app

This app first asks users what food items they have at home, then looks for recipes online matching the ingredients. It then ✄ those recipes apart, and ♻️ them into new unique never-before-seen, (probably) delicious delicacies.

Since the results of riz-razzing through the online field of recipes returns something that _looks_ like a valid recipes, it might calm the insecure user's mind and allow them to participate in covert experimentation.

And in the end, what else are recipes but time-proven results of such experimentation! Maybe something good comes out of this, and there won't be the need to write it down anymore. : )

## disclaimer

I think this thing should better never get released as a product, because it would be a shame if a timidly attempting creator/creatrice would end up disappointed by their creation and consequently return to their yearly subscription with the local pizzeria mega chain.

Also, I'm learning Redux.
